    <h2>Description -</h2>
    <p>I heard a legend when I was a kid of a ghostly wyvern, and I've been following that ghost all these years.</p> 
    <p>My sleuthing tells me that it must live somewhere in a land of ice and snow... What I need you for is to capture it.</p> 
    <p>I'll take care of the songwriting duties. - Wandering Bard </p>
